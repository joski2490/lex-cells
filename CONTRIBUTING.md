# Contributing to LexCells

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

While there's certainly plenty to do, unfortunately there's not a lot of individual tasks that can be tackled before I finish
working on the core-functionality / simulation-loop.  Once that's out of the way I'll update this document to reflect
contributions you could make.

In the mean time, if you're at all interested in this kind of thing and have ideas for more genes/expressions, behaviors,
or functionality you'd expect this type of project to have, be sure to raise a question in the Issues section and let
me know.

Thanks.
